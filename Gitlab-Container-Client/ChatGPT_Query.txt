Write a Dockerfile which is based on Amazon Linux 2023 image, then install Busybox, then install curl-devel, then install the root ca, then build OpenSSH from source code without tcl/tk and GetText, then build Git from source code without tcl/tk and GetText, then enable RSA in sshd_config, then install the Gitlab client, then create an Entrypoint which imports the Gitlab client ssh key from /dev/1/environ/SSH_KEY (spllitting the value on the "=" sign) at runtime, then execute proot (proot should exclude /etc/mtab, etc/resolv.conf, /etc/hosts, /etc, /sys, and /proc) and execute kaniko with proot in a subdirectory, then execute the Entrypoint using Tini, then "sleep infinity" at the end of the Endtrypoint, then create the Cloudformation which executes this Fargate container with SYS_PTRACE enabled and creates the security group and subnet for it.
