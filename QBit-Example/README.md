###

An example of using QBit
This project is interesting because it does not use Spring
but still allows for intuitive construction.
Further QBit provdies integrated health checks

Goals:
Create a /metrics endpoint
Create a /health endpoint
Create an /api endpoint which displays Swagger

Down side:
No one uses this framework
probably quarkus, as it is backed by red hat
